<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<ul>
    <li><h2>Sketching and fine art. </h2></li>
    I like to draw and sketch a lot. It has become one of the things I can't think of not being in my life as it has become one of my escapes from the real world. I  express my thought and what's on my mind by pouring it all out on the paper. It makes me feel grounded again.
    <li><h2>Cooking</h2></li>
    One of the most enjoyed activity for me is cooking new dishes and exploring new flavours. As I myself am a foodie thus i love to eat deliscious foods and thus cooking them and feeding to others also give me immense joy and satisfaction.
    <li><h2>Reading fiction</h2></li>
    I like to live in my delulu world and this is only achieved through the imaginary world of the fictions we read. The books open a new world where I can be anything I want and can do anything without a care in the world . This brings me immense happiness and let me enjoy my time.
    <li><h2>Long drives</h2></li>
    Who doesn't love themselves some long drive in nice weather. And when you are the one driving the Bike/ Car then the joy becomes hundred times more. Just add a playlist of your favourite songs and you are in for a ride of life.
    <li><h2>Watching Dramas and Listening to Songs </h2></li>
    As a die hard fan of the k-pop industry , it would be a crime if I wouldn't listen to songs 24/7 . Also I'm a sucker for pretty faces thus k/j/c/any dramas are a must.
